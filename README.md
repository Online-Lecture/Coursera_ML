# Machine Learning
## Introduction
This repository is for **Machine Learning**  ,mainly my lecture notes or codes are for my own comprehension.  
As I had been through some difficulties in understanding "fancy words" of machine learning, I've decided to upload my personal notes to share things that haven't covered in the lecture.  
I hope these will be your supplement for better understanding machine learning.  

## Before Starting..
