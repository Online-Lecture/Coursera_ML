# Machine Learning
## Introduction
This repository is for **Machine Learning**  ,mainly my lecture notes or codes are for my own comprehension.  
As I had been through some difficulties in understanding "fancy words" of machine learning, I've decided to upload my personal notes to share things that haven't covered in the lecture.  
So there would be no uploads for answer sheets.  
I hope these will be your supplement for better understanding machine learning.  

## Before Starting..
