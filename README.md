# Machine Learning
This repository is for **Machine Learning**  ,mainly my lecture notes or codes are for my own comprehension.

## Before Starting..
As I had been through some difficulties in learning "fancy words" of machine learning, I've decided to uploaded these to share my process of understanding of machine learning via lecture notes and codes.  
So there would be no uploads for answer sheets or offical lecture documents.  
I hope these will be your supplements in your future study.
